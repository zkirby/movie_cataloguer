A small but fun movie cataloguer sure to satisfy the Movie and SQL enthusiast in all of us

# About
I built this system after realizing that sorting my movies by hand was getting well... a little out of hand. Has some cool features such as running a five number summary on ratings and some other cool statistical features. Built for those who want to sort and rank the movies they watch but need a database to do so. This was built with Python3 and with SQLite3
